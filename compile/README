Compile 1.0 Alpha
=================

The compile module replaces the built-in MUSH functions u() and ulocal()
with versions that do byte-compiling on the evaluated attributes and cache
the results. This will result in a significant speed-up for certain types of
code, at the expense of memory used to cache the compiled attributes.

Installing
==========

Untar the compile archive in the 'src/modules' subdirectory. You must then
rebuild your MUSH binaries by typing (from the top directory):

./Build --enable-modules=comsys,mail,compile

The argument to the '--enable-modules' parameter is a comma-separated list
of modules names. Note that this only tells the build process to compile the
modules. You must still enable them in your config file with 'module
<modulename>'. Once the build is finished, add the 'module compile'
directive to your config file.

How it works
============

The compile module transparently replaces u() and ulocal(). You do not have
to modify any of your softcode.

Configuration Parameters
========================

The compile module takes no configuration parameters.

Tips
====

The compile module currently does not support the TRACE flag; an object set
TRACE will skip any evaluations done by the new u() and ulocal() functions.
This will be supported in a later release.
